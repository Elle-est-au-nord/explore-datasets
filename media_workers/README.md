# Journalists & media workers killed (2018 to 2023)

Back in 2018, I made a D3 bubblechart on Observable with data of journalists killed that year. I hadn't updated the notebook with more recent data until January 2024.
A lot of journalists were killed in 2023 in the Gaza strip and Southern Lebanon by the Israeli army. I could see the number go up every week on social media.
Looking at the past 6 years, it's indeed disturbing to see that the number of journalists (and media workers) killed is not only back on the rise, but the number of journalists killed in Occupied Palestinian Territories in 2023 (77) is higher than worlwide journalists killed
