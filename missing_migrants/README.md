# Missing Migrants Project by International Organization for Migration (IOM)

Note: Data IOM data updated on 28 August 2024

While browsing projects created on Observable, a project by Nicolas Lambert called "Dead and Missing Migrants in the Mediterranean" caught my attention (project [link](https://observablehq.com/@neocartocnrs/dead-and-missing-migrants)). 
This is how I discovered the IOM database on missing migrants and forked the project mentionned above to visualize migrants missing worldwide, although the Mediterranean is the location where the more deaths and disappearances are recorded.
