# Visualizing Missing Migrants

Latest data update: February 18, 2025

While browsing projects created on Observable, a project by Nicolas Lambert called "Dead and Missing Migrants in the Mediterranean" caught my attention (project [link](https://observablehq.com/@neocartocnrs/dead-and-missing-migrants)). 
This is how I discovered the IOM database on missing migrants and forked the project mentionned above to visualize migrants missing worldwide: [notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/9bd19632957d127f)
More recently, I created a new Observable notebook to visualize this dataset using only D3.js. See [notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/68b689c8063a0396)
